(referred to as features) of an observation (one row in your dataframe) in order to predict something about the observation. This something is a desired target (also referred to as label). In a nutshell, we throw this data into a machine learning algorithm (we will import a machine learning library), which in turn will look for patterns that describes the relationship between the input and output data. Based on this, the machine learning algorithm will return a generic model to us, which we can use for predictions in the future.\n","\n","\n","In this assignment we are going to predict if it will rain in Australia the next day, based on various characteristics (features) that can be measured the previous day. Having collected a lot of historical data over many days, we can find such a relationship. Ideally, if we develop a good model we can predict Australia's weather tomorrow prospectively.\n","\n","\n","The \"RainTomorrow\" column is the so-called label. The \"Date\" column is simply an index. The other columns are the so-called features."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"dsTkBv1B2kxz"},"source":["Assignment 1.0\n","\n","Import Pandas, import the CSV 'weather_aus.csv' file and print the first couple of rows.
